# Mixins-In-Dart

This repo has a code for using Mixins in dart.

## Installation

Just download the repo and you are good to go.

## Overview:

Here I have 4 classes and one mixin:

1. Boy class.
2. Girl class.
3. Dog class.
4. Person class.
5. Walking mixin.

## What I did in this simple example:

- Here we have two functions the first one is cry() and the second is walk()
- In order to use these functions in Boy, Dog, Girl classes I used Person class and mixin Walking.
- The reason is that I want to share walk functionality in multiple classes without repeating the code.
